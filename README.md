"Welcome to our introduction on Japanese Candlestick Charting.

Think of candlestick charting as an X-ray of the market. It doesn't just show you the price; it reveals the supply and demand situation underneath. It is the only technical tool that truly measures the 'emotional component' of the market.

Remember, fundamental analysis tells you what to buy, but technical analysis tells you when to buy.

However, candlesticks are not a complete system on their own. You should always use them in conjunction with Western technical tools to get the full picture.

Now, let's look at the anatomy of a candle.

The thick part is called the 'Real Body.' This represents the essence of the price movement—the range between the open and the close. The thin lines above and below are called 'Shadows,' or wicks. These show the extreme price fluctuations that happened during the session.

Color is critical here. A white, or empty, body means the close was higher than the open. This is bullish. A black, or filled, body means the close was lower than the open. This is bearish.

Simply put: a long white body tells you the Bulls are in charge. A long black body tells you the Bears are taking over."
